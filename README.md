# 90's Trivia Game Project

## Summary and Goals

90's Trivia Game is a web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap & jQuery to create a multiple choice game. The 90's Trivia Game is a timed trivia game that counts down via intervals. A counter keeps track of how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, or not at all.  The results are displayed at the end of the quiz.  Once the quiz restarts, all counters are reset.  The questions are hard coded and will repeat.
